## More Than Two Samples Hypothesis Test for Variance
### If all samples are normally distributed
Preparation Code
```
# Functions
library(dplyr)

# Sample Data
library(wooldridge)
G <- gpa2
G$ethnicity <- ifelse(G$black == 1, "Black",
                  ifelse(G$white ==1, "White",
                         ifelse(G$black ==0 & G$white == 0, "Others", -1)))
```
**Actual Code**
```
bartlett.test(G$sat, G$ethnicity)
```
### If any sample is / some samples are not normally distributed
**Actual Code**
```
fligner.test(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species)
```
